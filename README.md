# Extract Tree Reflectance from Satellite Imagery Using GIS Software

This is a QGIS plugin developed to support Geocarto Tree Monitoring System (GTMS): A New Technology to Detect Internal Warning Indicators of Stressed Trees

The monitoring of tree stress makes use of 3 multispectral bands (near-infrared, red edge and red) and pansharpening technique. The changes in spectral reflectance of the 3 bands can reflect the health conditions of tree, including the subtle changes in chlorophyll content and leaf cellular structure.

Details of the technology: https://www.geocarto.hk/

Download "gic_tree_monitoring_tool.zip" and install it as a new plugin in QGIS 3 (https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
