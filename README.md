# Extract Tree Reflectance from Satellite Imagery Using GIS Software

This is a QGIS plugin developed to support Geocarto Tree Monitoring System (GTMS): A New Technology to Detect Internal Warning Indicators of Stressed Trees

The monitoring of tree stress makes use of 3 multispectral bands (near-infrared, red edge and red) and pansharpening technique. The changes in spectral reflectance of the 3 bands can reflect the health conditions of tree, including the subtle changes in chlorophyll content and leaf cellular structure.
